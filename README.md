## Student Submissions

### Ujwal's Candy Shop 
- Ujwal owns a candy shop and wants to create an Automatic Door System that opens when
customers approach during the day but remains closed at night, as the shop closes as soon as
the sun sets. Design a system that automatically operates the door based on the time of day,
ensuring it only functions while it's light outside.
Bonus: Include a manual override feature that allows the door to be opened or closed
regardless of the time of day.
